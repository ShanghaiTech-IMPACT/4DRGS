## [Arxiv] | [Project Page](https://shanghaitech-impact.github.io/4DRGS/)

We present 4DRGS, the first Gaussian splatting-based framework for efficient 3D vessel reconstruction from sparse-view dynamic DSA images. Our method achieves impressive results within minutes, highlighting its potential for clinical applications.

# Releasing
We will release our code and some test cases once our paper accepted. To be continue. If you have any question, just reach out to the author: liuzht2022@shanghaitech.edu.cn
