We present 4DRGS, the first Gaussian splatting-based framework for efficient 3D vessel reconstruction from sparse-view dynamic DSA images. Our method achieves impressive results with sparse input (30 views) in minutes, highlighting its potential to support real-world medical assessment while reducing radiation exposure.
