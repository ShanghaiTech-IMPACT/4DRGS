Code for **IPMI 2025 Oral** paper.
We present 4DRGS, the first Gaussian splatting-based framework for efficient 3D vessel reconstruction from sparse-view dynamic DSA images. Our method achieves impressive results with sparse input (30 views) in minutes, highlighting its potential to support real-world medical assessment while reducing radiation exposure.

## Updated Feature
- **[2025-08-07]** tiny-cuda-nn now comes with a just-in-time (JIT) compilation mode. We have updated this feature in `scene/field.py` by setting `model.jit_fusion = tcnn.supports_jit_fusion()`, which provides some speed improvements. Note that `tinycudann>=2.0` is required. Results in our paper is reported with `tinycudann==1.7`.

## Setup
First clone this repo. And then set up an environment and install packages. C++ Compiler is required. We used Visual Studio 2019 for Windows and GCC 8.3.0 for Linux.

    git clone https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/4DRGS.git
    cd 4DRGS
    conda create -n 4DRGS python=3.8
    conda activate 4DRGS
    pip install torch==2.1.2+cu118 torchvision==0.16.2+cu118 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    git clone https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE.git
    cd TIGRE
    pip install .
    cd ..
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/nvlabs/tiny-cuda-nn
    cd tiny-cuda-nn/bindings/torch
    python setup.py install
    cd ../../..
    pip install submodules/diff-Xray-gaussian-rasterization-voxelization
    pip install submodules/simple-knn
    
## Data-Preparation
We provide `case2` in our paper, and you can find it in this [data link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vNnNfgAFzntEOZIhjm3PRMGh-1Vf2GeR?usp=sharing), including fill run, mask run, reference reconstructed volume from DSA scanner, reference mesh, and geometry description json file.
You may use it for quick validation.

# Training
After downloading the data, you could run the following command to train your model.

    python train.py -m=output/case2_30v_30k -s=./dataset/case2 --Nviews=30

In this way, you would train a model with 30 input views on case2 for 30k iteration, finished in tens of minutes. You can also train a fast version in several minutes as follows.

    python train.py -m=output/case2_30v_10k -s=./dataset/case2 --Nviews=30 --iteration=10000 --ADC_until_iter=5000

## Testing
Use the following commands to test your trained model. It would conduct multi-view rendering, fix-view rendering, and 3D vessel reconstruction.

    python test.py -m=output/case2_30v_30k -s=./dataset/case2 --Nviews=30 --render_2d --render_fixview --VQR
    python test.py -m=output/case2_30v_10k -s=./dataset/case2 --Nviews=30 --iteration=10000 --render_2d --render_fixview --VQR
