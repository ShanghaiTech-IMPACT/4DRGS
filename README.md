This is the official repo of our paper **4DRGS: 4D Radiative Gaussian Splatting for Efficient 3D Vessel Reconstruction from Sparse-View Dynamic DSA Images**. In this work, we present 4DRGS, the first Gaussian splatting-based framework for sparse-view DSA reconstruction. Our method achieves impressive 3D vessel reconstruction within minutes, highlighting its potential for clinical applications.
